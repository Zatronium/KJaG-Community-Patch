Message {

	DisplayText:  Another solution to the problem of cargo capacity! We've fitted Armagordon with a Portable Wormhole Generator. With the addition of the Portable Hole, ten percent of all resources picked up by the Creature are transported directly to base. Pretty nifty!

	DisplayText:  Our final attempt at a solution to the problem of injuries in the field, Master. The MASH Unit is a portable mechanized field hospital with the capacity to restore the Creature to full health two times. Think of it is as the world's biggest first aid kit, for kaiju-sized boo-boos!
