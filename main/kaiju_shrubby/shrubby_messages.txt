	DisplayText: Mean Green has been running into some pretty toxic enemy fire in the field, boss. I mixed Her up a formula that should flush away all that poison and negativity in combat. Purification is like a 30-day cleanse that only takes a few seconds.

	DisplayText: Hydration is important boss, especially if you're a Giant Green Mulch Machine like Shrubby. Her new water storing buds should help her beat the heat. The heat of being on fire, that is.

	DisplayText: Wow, purty flowers! And when Shrubby fires a burst of thousands at once, the Chaff Blossom attack will blind all tracking weapons until the cloud disperses. I love this job!

	DisplayText: The ultimate floral bombardment! Unleash the Sakura Storm and for thirty seconds no one will be able to get a missile lock on the Mean Green Mother. She's harder to hit with conventional weapons too. It's win-win!
