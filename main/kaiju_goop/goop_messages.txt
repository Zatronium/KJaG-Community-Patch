	DisplayText:  Even the best nanites have room for improvement, my dear. I've upgraded the Construct with Nano Boosters, which should help it to dissipate waste heat more quickly in battle--this will decrease cooldown times for all its abilities.

Message {
	Identifier: msg_goop_Hunger
	DisplayText: I was in the cafeteria the other day and it occurred to me--what if we could increase the Grey Goop's appetite? I tried speeding up the metabolism of the nanites, and sure enough--their Hunger makes them WAY more destructive per second. Stands to reason, though. I mean, we know what happens when I let your blood sugar drop too low...

Message {
	Identifier: msg_goop_RepairaGoop
	DisplayText:  The Construct definitely seems alive at times, doesn't it? This new healing protocol is self-generated--the kaiju slows down 75 percent and re-routes its energies to healing for 30 seconds, bringing its health back to full. I call it RepairaGOOP. Kaiju self care! Isn't that amazing?

Message {

Message {

	DisplayText:  The good news is...I worked out a deal with Julius Urkelberg to download all the latest medical data from Armagordon for a while. The bad news is... I had to cough some of our nanites to seal the deal. So the Atomic Menace is going to end up having some nanotech abilities--and we're going to get to play with ArmoGOOPdon 3!

Message {

Message {

Message {

This new code jazzes up the GOOP's ability to cycle all its powers. As long as the Construct has health under 75 percent, it should be attacking way faster from now on!

Message {
	Identifier: msg_goop_RevivaGoop
	DisplayText:  Just working on a failsafe system to try and avoid losing the GOOP in battle. This RevivaGOOP protocol prevents the Construct from dispersing for an extra 15 seconds, giving it a chance to regenerate or restore its health before death. If it can't get up to 25 percent health before the clock runs out, though--our Grey buddy is gonna go splat.

I decided to work with him this weekend to see if I could upgrade them with some of my memory code, and sure enough--it worked! This new ReGOOP ability means that the GOOPlings have a chance to repawn when they die. That should keep the KDF busy!
